## Description
In my directory there are three challenges in their files namely:
## code 1 challenge 12-Hour to 24-Hour Time Conversion
## code challenge 2 Two positive Number checker
## code challenge 3 Consonant

## Installation Process into the directory
* Git clone the repository 'git clone git@github.com:MiriamRehema/python-code-challenge-1.git'
* Navigate to the project directory with the command `cd python-code-challenge-1`
  if needed:
* install pipenv by using this command `pipenv --python 3.8.10 install `

* Then run using this command `pipenv shell`


## code 1 challenge 12-Hour to 24-Hour Time Conversion
Converting a 12-hour time format (such as "8:30 am" or "8:30 pm") to a 24-hour time format (like "0830" or "2030") involves handling different cases for morning ("am") and afternoon/evening ("pm") times. This code demonstrates the conversion process using a Python function.


1. Open the Python file `Convert_to_24_hour.py` in your preferred code editor.

2. Define the `convert_to_24_hour` function by providing the hour (in the range of 1 to 12), minute (in the range of 0 to 59), and period ("am" or "pm").

3. Run the code inside this file
 

## code challenge 2 Two positive Number checker
The `two_are_positive` function takes three integer arguments: `a`, `b`, and `c`. It checks if exactly two out of the three numbers are positive. The goal is to determine whether the function returns `True` or `False` based on the given criteria.


1. Open the Python file `Two_are_positive.py` in your preferred code editor.

2. Define the `two_are_positive` function as provided in the code.

3. Run the script by executing the file in your terminal:


## code challenge 3 Consonant substring value calculator
This code snippet demonstrates a function that calculates the highest value of consonant substrings within a given string.

1. Open the Python file `Consonant_substring_value.py` in your preferred code editor.

2. Define the `solve` function as provided in the code.

3. Run the script .


## Technology used
The challenge was mainly based on pyhton, so I used the following technologies:
- python version (the one you have)


# Conclusion

Completing this challenge was a great opportunity for me to use my knowledge of Python. I had a nice experience working on the different tasks and I look forward to building more projects using Python.
